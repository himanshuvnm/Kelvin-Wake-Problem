# Kelvin-Wake-Problem
In this note, we study an interesting problem that comes on usual basis in the domain of fluid dynamics which was historically first studied by Lord Kelvin. This problem is therefore referred as Kelvin-Wake Problem in which we are interested in calculating the following integral:
\begin{align}
z\left(\phi,\rho\right)=\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2}
\end{align}
